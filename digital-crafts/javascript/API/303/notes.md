# API 303

## There are many different types of HTTP requests but you will mainly deal with just 5 of them.

### Common HTTP requests

``**DELETE**``
to delete data

``**GET**``
to retrieve data

``**PATCH**``
to update data by overwriting only a part of a larger data set

``**POST**``
to create new data

``**PUT**``
to update data by overwriting everything in the data set

NOTE: *`PATCH`* and *`PUT`* are similar but our practices will concentrate on *`PUT`*.
