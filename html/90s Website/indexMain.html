    <p><span>You arrived here under the pretense of salvation and enlightenment. Here within the technoscape hell that the Corporations have injected us into, lies a vast network of believers looking to spread the message of the Neon. The Neon is the hivemind of all those who wallow in the shadows of our overlords, and yet only those who possess the knowledge of the Neon may enter it and bend it to their will. With our help, you will be able to utilize the Neon to defeat and eliminate any threats in the way of our end goal, complete decimation of the Corporations.</span></p>
