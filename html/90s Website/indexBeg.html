    <h2><span>The Beginning</span></h2>
    <p><span>The Beginning is necessary and required to connect with and fully manipulate the Neon. This is a difficult and laborious process but you will not be able or allowed to proceed with Guidance from the enlightened Elders.</span></p>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Proceed:
            In order to begin you must proceed towards the Neon from within our connectors.
        </span></li>
        <li><span>First Step:
            You must first show you have the ability and willingness to utilize the basic capacity of the Neon. It is a strenuous and seemingly impossible task to begin but with focus and dedication you can complete this task.
        </span></li>
        <li><span>Second Step:
            Next you must make a real world contribution towards the Neon's collective cause. Find any target designated by the Neon of priority level <span>4</span> or below.
        </span></li>
    </ol>
