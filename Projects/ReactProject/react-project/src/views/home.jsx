  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to professor Maggie's React Project utilizing the <a href='https://pokeapi.co/'>PokeApi</a> and the <a href='https://docs.pokemontcg.io/'>PokemonTCG API</a>!</p>
  <p>This is my second time utilizing these APIs but I wanted to do them justice by using my updated front end skills utilizng React.JS and Redux!</p>
  <p>I do plan on implementing a search function as well as more styling but the current product reflects my goals of creating a functioning TCG app. </p>
  <p>I wanted to highlight not only the cardmarket so you could find the cards yourselves but their artists as well.</p>
