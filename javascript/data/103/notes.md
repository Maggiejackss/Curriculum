# JavaScript Data 102
## The data types for 'null' and 'undefined' are a little different than other, simpler data types.

### 'null'
```
let captainName = 'null';
console.log(captainName) --> null
```
'null' means absence of a value (intentional), essentially saying we don't want it to have a value until we have a value to input


### 'undefined'
```
let captainName;
console.log(captainName) --> undefined
```
undefined means there is no value for variable
null and undefined are values but a type in and of themselves, like strings, booleans and numbers
