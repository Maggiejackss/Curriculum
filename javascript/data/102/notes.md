# JavaScript Data 102
## Three simple data types

##string
A string is defined with either '1' or "1"
```
let location = 'Atlanta, Georgia';
```
##boolean
The value of a boolean is either true or false
```
const isNew = false;
```
##number
pretty straightforward but 'number' cannot write really, really big numbers
```
let age = 32;
```
